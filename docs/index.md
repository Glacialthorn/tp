**EstateMate is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using EstateMate, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f08a-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#2-quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing EstateMate, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f08a-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
