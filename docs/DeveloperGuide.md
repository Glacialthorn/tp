## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TenantListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:**
* `MainWindow` stores a reference to a `Model` interface instance. This is to pass the `Model` instance to `TenantListPanel` as well as to retrieve job information for `JobListPanel`. 
* `TenantCard` has a stronger association with the `Model` component because it stores a reference to a `Model` interface instance. However, this is used only retrieve and display jobs linked to a tenant.
</box>
* 
### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTenantCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an **`EstateMateParser`** object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteTenantCommandParser` or `AddJobCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteTenantCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a tenant or add a job).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the **`EstateMateParser`** class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddTenantCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddTenantCommand`) which the **`EstateMateParser`** returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddTenantCommandParser`, `DeleteTenantCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.


### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the EstateMate data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)



### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/estatemate/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both EstateMate data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `EstateMateStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.estatemate.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Job feature

#### Implementation Overview

This section explains how **Jobs** are modelled, parsed, stored, and presented.

#### Model

- **Core Types**
    - `Job` fields: `id:int`, `description:Description`, `isDone:boolean`.
    - `Description` validates non-blank descriptions.
    - `UniqueJobList` maintains all jobs; guarantees **uniqueness by description** via `Job#isSameJob`. Provides add/remove/mark/unmark and an unmodifiable observable view.

- **Ownership & Access**
    - `EstateMate` owns a `UniqueJobList` and provides:
        - `addJob(Job)`
        - `removeJobById(int)`
        - `markJobById(int)`
        - `unmarkJobById(int)`
        - `getJobList()`
        - `nextJobId()` *(computed as `max(id)+1`, defaulting to `1`)*
    - `ModelManager` forwards these model operations and exposes:
        - `addJob(Job)`
        - `deleteJobById(int)`
        - `editJobById(int, Description)`
        - `markJobById(int)`
        - `unmarkJobById(int)`
        - `getFilteredJobList()`
        - `updateFilteredJobList(Predicate<Job>)`
        - `nextJobId()`
        - `getJobDescriptionById(int)`
        - `isJobCompleted(int)`
        - `hasJobWithDescription(Description)`


- **Tenant References**
    - `Person` keeps `List<Integer> jobs` (job **ids**).  
      Deleting a job **cascades**: the job is removed and its id is stripped from all personsâ€™ `jobs` lists.

<puml src="diagrams/JobModelClassDiagram.puml" width="720" />

#### Logic

- **Commands**
    - `AddJobCommand` (`job d/<desc>`) parses `Description`, allocates id via `Model#nextJobId()`, adds job.
    - `EditJobCommand` (`ejob <id> d/<desc>`) updates job **description** for the given id; preserves `isDone`.
    - `DeleteJobCommand` (`djob <id>`) removes job and triggers cascade unlink from tenants.
    - `MarkJobCommand` / `UnmarkJobCommand` (`mark <id>` / `unmark <id>`) toggles completion.
    - `FindJobCommand` (`fjob KEYWORDSâ€¦`) filters by case-insensitive keywords with `JobContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

- **Parsers**
    - `AddJobCommandParser`, `EditJobCommandParser`, `DeleteJobCommandParser`,
      `MarkJobCommandParser`, `UnmarkJobCommandParser`, `FindJobCommandParser`
      tokenize arguments, validate fields, and construct commands.

- **Post-mutation behaviour**
    - After any mutation, `ModelManager` resets the filter to `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_JOBS`.

<puml src="diagrams/JobAddSequence.puml" width="720" />

#### Storage

- **JSON Mapping**
    - `JsonAdaptedJob` <-> `Job` with fields  
      `{ "id": number (>0), "description": string, "isDone": boolean }`.
    - `JsonSerializableEstateMate` rejects duplicates **by id** or **by description**. Load errors surface as `DataLoadingException`; the app then starts with an **empty** dataset (AB-3 fallback path).

- **Save Flow**
    - After a successful command, `LogicManager` persists via `StorageManager#saveEstateMate(...)`.

<puml src="diagrams/JobStorageDiagram.puml" width="640" />

#### UI

- **Lists & Cards**
    - `JobListPanel` renders the `ObservableList<Job>`.
    - Each `JobCard` shows index, `id`, `description`, and a completion badge derived from `isDone`.
    - The list updates automatically when `ModelManager`'s `filteredJobs` changes.

<puml src="diagrams/JobUiClassDiagram.puml" width="680" />

---

**Design Notes**

- **Safe startup**: duplicate jobs in storage (by id or description) cause load to fail; the app falls back to **empty** data.
- **Consistency**: job deletion removes any references from tenants (by id) to keep the model coherent.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Proposed features**

This section describes some noteworthy proposed features that may be implemented in the future.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `tenant n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `tenant` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `tenant n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
> **Note:** within 1 second for typical operations like listing, searching, adding, etc.
3.  Users with above-average typing speed should be able to perform most tasks **faster via commands** than using a mouse.

### Usability
1. The system should provide **clear, informative error messagaes to guide user** for invalid inputs.
2. Commands and outputs should follow a consistent format to minimize confusion.

### Reliability
1. Data should not be lost in case of sudden termination.
2. The system should handle invalid inputs without crashing or corrupting.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
